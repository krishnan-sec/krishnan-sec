# Krishnan Subramanian

Senior / Staff-level Security Engineer with experience securing cloud-native
products and enterprise platforms.

I focus on building practical, scalable security that enables engineering teams
while reducing systemic risk.

## 🔐 Areas of Focus

- Product & Application Security (Threat Modeling, Secure SDLC, Design Reviews)
- Cloud Security (AWS / Azure, IAM, Zero Trust)
- Security Architecture & Platform Security
- Vulnerability Management & Secure CI/CD
- Security Automation (Terraform, GitHub Actions, Python)
- AI & Security (GenAI risk, secure AI patterns)

## 🧠 Security Philosophy

- Security should scale with engineering velocity
- Controls should be automated or removed
- Design reviews prevent incidents better than alerts
- Documentation is a security control
- Security teams should be force multipliers
