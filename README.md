# Krishnan Subramanian

Senior / Staff-level Security Engineer with experience designing and scaling
security across cloud infrastructure, product applications (web and APIs),
enterprise environments, and endpoint ecosystems.

My work focuses on building **practical, sustainable security programs** that
integrate seamlessly with engineering workflows, enable product velocity, and
reduce systemic risk across the organization.

## 🔐 Core Focus Areas

- Product & Application Security  
  (Web applications, APIs, SaaS platforms, Threat Modeling, Secure SDLC)

- Cloud & Platform Security  
  (Azure / AWS, IAM, Zero Trust, Kubernetes, cloud-native architectures)

- Endpoint & Device Security  
  (Endpoint protection, device hardening, identity-driven access controls)

- Security Architecture & Engineering Enablement  
  (Design reviews, security patterns, guardrails, cross-team collaboration)

- Vulnerability Management and Secure CI/CD  
  (Risk prioritization, remediation workflows, pipeline security)

- Security Automation and Preventive Controls  
  (Terraform, n8n workflows, Python-based automation)

- AI & Security  
  (GenAI risk assessment, secure AI design patterns, model and data protection)

## 🧠 Security Principles

- Security must scale with engineering velocity
- Preventive design is more effective than reactive controls
- Automation is essential for consistency and scale
- Clear documentation is a security control
- Security teams should operate as force multipliers, not gatekeepers

## 📌 Purpose of This GitHub

This GitHub profile is used to share security patterns, reference architectures,
and practical examples informed by real-world systems, product constraints, and
engineering realities.
