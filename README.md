Senior / Staff-level Security Engineer with experience designing and scaling
security across cloud infrastructure, product applications (web and APIs),

I work at the intersection of **security architecture, product engineering, and
risk**, helping organizations embed security by design, scale preventive controls,
and enable teams to move fast without increasing exposure.
